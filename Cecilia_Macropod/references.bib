  abstract = {Post Occupancy Evaluation is a powerful assessment tool for zoo enclosure design, which incorporates animal enclosure use as a key component. Many authors suggest that naturalistic enclosures are valuable for animals, but objective analysis is required to support this statement. Studies of zoo animal enclosure use have become increasingly popular in published literature, and best practice enclosure design has now been investigated for many taxa. Several techniques are available to test animal enclosure use, including Spread of Participation Index (SPI), Electivity index, behavioural diversity and stereotypy prevalence. Given the variety of methods accessible to researchers, there is a need to evaluate which indices would best suit the research goals for a range of taxa. This review revealed a bias in favour of enclosure research for large carnivores and primates, though studies have also been initiated for birds and fish. Original SPI is well represented in published studies, as is stereotypy as a measure of enclosure suitability. By contrast, few published studies have used modified SPI, or Electivity index, which allow enclosures to be analysed at a resource level. Several influential studies combined behavioural analyses with SPI measurements to best understand animal enclosure use. Future directions in enclosure use may include the evaluation of thermal effects on enclosures, effects of visitors on zone use, and closer associations between enclosure use and associated behaviours. \&nbsp;},

  abstract = {The electivity indices Ei and Eiâ€² of predatorâ€“prey interaction are currently used to quantify particle-size selection by grazers. Under conditions of passive, mechanical particle-size selection predicted by the leaky-sieve model, these indices yield electivity vs. particle-size curves that vary with the shape of the particle-size spectrum of food offered to the zooplankton. In addition to this bias, poor estimates of electivity will be obtained unless only a small fraction of the food is eaten in such experiments. The selectivity coefficient (Wi) used by modelers in feeding constructs and the electivity index Ei*, derived here, are recommended instead because they do not suffer from the shortcomings described for Ei and Eiâ€². Moreover, use of Wiâ€²s and Ei*'s is recommended for quantifying selection for many other cases of predatorâ€“prey interaction. Key words: electivity indices, selectivity, selective grazing, predatorâ€“prey intraction},

  abstract = {Enclosure use assessments have gained popularity as one of the tools for animal welfare assessments and Post Occupancy Evaluations. There are now a plethora of studies and enclosure use indices available in published literature, and identification of the most appropriate index for each research question is often challenging. The benefits and limitations of four different enclosure use indices; Original and Modified Spread of Participation Index, Entropy, and Electivity Index were compared. Three artificial data sets were developed to represent the challenges commonly found in animal exhibits, and these indices were applied to these contrived enclosure settings. Three of the indices (Original SPI, Modified SPI, and Entropy) were used to assess a single measure of enclosure use variability. When zones within an exhibit were comparable in size, all three indices performed similarly. However, with less equal zone sizes, Modified SPI outperformed Original SPI and Entropy, suggesting that the Modified formula was more useful for assessing overall enclosure use variability under such conditions. Electivity Index assessed the use of individual zones, rather than the variability of use across the entire exhibit, and therefore could not be compared directly to the other three indices. This index is therefore most valuable for assessing individual resources, especially after exhibit modifications.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to develop and validate a fast and straightforward welfare assessment system to help shelter staff in decision-making processes. For newly captured dogs entering the shelter, the animal control officer (at capture time) and the veterinary officer (at entrance examination) compiled a form attributing a qualitative score for the overall Stress level and for 5 Descriptors of dog behavioural traits. Furthermore, a tester filled out the same form by subjecting the dog to a test battery in his pen, besides performing behavioural observations. The veterinary officer and the tester repeated the evaluation protocol after four weeks of acclimatisation in the shelter. The analysis evaluated inter-observer and testâ€“retest reliability, internal consistency, and construct validity of qualitative scores. Overall, we collected 258 forms regarding 189 dogs. Principal component (PC) extracted by Descriptors showed a good correlation with the Stress level score for veterinary and tester confirming the internal consistency of these scales while it was low for animal control officer form. Moreover, qualitative evaluations of the veterinarian and the tester showed congruent correlations with behavioural observations supporting their construct validity. Conversely, the scores expressed by the animal control officer were not consistent with quantitative observations. Then, the veterinary officer and tester forms could be validated and further simplified including only Stress level score while the control officer form requires a revision as it does not seem reliable. We did not find agreement between the Stress level scores expressed by animal control officer, veterinary and tester suggesting that the three contexts represent different stress stimuli to which the same dog reacts differently. The point of view of the three evaluators can increase the reliability of the assessment. Static but vigilant behaviours prevailed in newly sheltered dogs but activity, interactions and behavioural diversity increased in the second behavioural observation when the dogs were kept in multiple cages and four weeks of adaptation had passed. Stress level reduced and PCs tended towards the pole of sociability suggesting a reduction of stress after the period of adaptation to the socio-environmental conditions of the shelter. On the other hand, the considerable inter-individual variability in behaviours reflects differences in coping strategies and or in the manifestation of stress. Our simple tool can not replace a multidisciplinary approach to welfare assessment but could help shelter staff for individual management of dogs complying with their different adaptation skills.},
